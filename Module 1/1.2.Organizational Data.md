# Introduction to Cybersecurity

## 1.2.1 Types of Organizational Data

### 1.2.1.1 Traditional Data
Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. It includes the following:

- **Transactional data** such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment decisions.
- **Intellectual property** such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a company.
- **Financial data** such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which provide insight into the health of a company.

### 1.2.1.2 Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data
IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology and business called 'Big Data.'

## 1.2.2 The Cube
The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:

1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems.
2. The protection of information in each of its possible states.
3. The security measures used to protect data.

### The foundational principles for protecting information
- **Confidentiality** is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes. Methods to ensure confidentiality include **data encryption, identity proofing and two factor authentication**.

- **Integrity** ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure integrity is to use a **hash function or checksum**.

- **Availability** means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by **maintaining equipment, performing hardware repairs, keeping operating systems and software up to date, and creating backups**.

### The protection of information in each state
- *Processing** refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data in process).

- **Storage** refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid-state drive or USB drive (data at rest).

- **Transmission** refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit).

### The security measures used to protect data
- **Awareness, training and education** are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.

- **Technology** refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.

- **Policy and procedure** refers to the administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines.

## 1.2.3 What Do You Think?
A concerned customer has forwarded on what they believe to be a fraudulent email. It looks as if it has been sent by @Apollo but something appears a little 'phish-y.'

![An email entitled Security Notice from POLLO <service@@polo.com> to you. It features a pixilated @pollo logo at the top and reads: Dear Ms Patel, As a precautionary measure we restricted access to your Account until you validate has been changed. To prevent further irregular activity, you will be unable to access your account until this issue has been resolved To fix security info, click below to reactivate your account. http://123contactform.com/contact-form-@apollo.234.54674.html @pollo Support Team](/Module%201/img/An-email-from-pollo.svg)

Take a look at the email. Which of the following indicates that it is in fact a phishing email? Don’t forget, you have a chance to earn valuable defender points if you answer this correctly.

[x] Graphics
[ ] Customer name
[x] Email address
[x] Link URL
[x] The language, spelling and grammar

**That’s right! You know exactly what to look out for and have earned yourself some defender points — well done!**

Closer inspection reveals:

- that the sender's email domain is spelled incorrectly
- that the link URL is not pointing to @Apollo's website
- poor language, spelling and grammar
- low quality, pixelated graphics

Phishing emails can be hard to detect. For example, they will often address you by name to appear legitimate, but hackers can easily find this information on the Internet. So, it’s important to stay alert and think before you click.

## 1.2.4 Is This for Real?
Yes, phishing is very common and often works. For example, in August 2020, elite gaming brand Razer experienced a data breach which exposed the personal information of approximately 100,000 customers.

A security consultant discovered that a cloud cluster (a group of linked servers providing data storage, databases, networking, and software through the Internet), was misconfigured and exposed a segment of Razer’s infrastructure to the public Internet, resulting in a data leak. 

It took Razer more than three weeks to secure the cloud instance from public access, during which time cybercriminals had access to customer information that could have been used in social engineering and fraud attacks, like the one you uncovered just now. 

Organizations therefore need to take a proactive approach to cloud security to ensure that sensitive data is secured.

## 1.2.5 Data Security Breaches
- The Persirai botnet
  - In 2017, an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet, Persirai, targeted over 1,000 different models of Internet Protocol (IP) cameras, accessing open ports to inject a command that forced the cameras to connect to a site which installed malware on them. Once the malware was downloaded and executed, it deleted itself and was therefore able to run in memory to avoid detection.
  - Over 122,000 of these cameras from several different manufacturers were hijacked and used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, without the knowledge of their owners. A DDoS attack occurs when multiple devices infected with malware flood the resources of a targeted system.
  - The IoT is connecting more and more devices, creating more opportunities for cybercriminals to attack.
- Equifax Inc.
  - In September 2017, Quifax, a consumer credit reporting agency in the United States, publicly announced a data breach event: Attackers had been able to exploit a vulnerability in its web application software to gain access to the sensitive personal data of millions of customers.
  - In response to this breach, Equifax established a dedicated website that allowed Equifax customers to determine if their information was compromised. However, instead of using a subdomain of equifax.com, the company set up a new domain name, which allowed cybercriminals to create unauthorized websites with similar names. These websites were used to try and trick customers into providing personal information.
  - Attackers could use this information to assume a customer's identity. In such cases, it woulld be very difficult for the customer to prove otherwise, given that the hacker is also privy to their personal information.

If you are ever faced with a similar situation, quickly verify if your information was compromised, so that you can minimize the impact. Keep in mind that, in a time of crisis, you may be tricked into using unauthorized websites.

Always be vigilant when providing personally identifiable information over the Internet. Check your credit reports regularly and immediately report any false information, such as applications for credit that you did not initiate or purchases on your credit cards that you did not make.

## 1.2.6 Consequences of a Security Breach
These examples show that the potential consequences of a security breach can be severe.

- Reputational damage
  - A security breach can have a negative long-term impact on an organization’s reputation that has taken years to build. Customers, particularly those who have been adversely affected by the breach, will need to be notified and may seek compensation and/or turn to a reliable and secure competitor. Employees may also choose to leave in light of a scandal.
  - Depending on the severity of a breach, it can take a long time to repair an organization’s reputation.
- Vandalism
  - A hacker or hacking group may vandalize an organization’s website by posting untrue information. They might even just make a few minor edits to your organization’s phone number or address, which can be trickier to detect.
  - In either case, online vandalism can portray unprofessionalism and have a negative impact on your organization’s reputation and credibility.
- Theft
  - A data breach often involves an incident where sensitive personal data has been stolen. Cybercriminals can make this information public or exploit it to steal an individual’s money and/or identity.
- Loss of revenue
  - The financial impact of a security breach can be devastating. For example, hackers can take down an organization’s website, preventing it from doing business online. A loss of customer information may impede company growth and expansion. It may demand further investment in an organization’s security infrastructure. And let’s not forget that organizations may face large fines or penalties if they do not protect online data.
- Damaged intellectual property
  - A security breach could also have a devastating impact on the competitiveness of an organization, particularly if hackers are able to get their hands on confidential documents, trade secrets and intellectual property.

Despite the best of intentions and all the safeguards you can put in place, protecting organizations from every cyberattack is not feasible.

Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to attack and, eventually, they will succeed.

When they do, it will be up to cybersecurity professionals, like you, to respond quickly to minimize its impact.
